# hist

Just a simple deployment test.
Worked well with https://mybinder.org with the following steps:

1. Install Voila (pip install voila), and check the availability by pressing new Voila button in your notebook.
2. Save ipynb and requirements.txt files here on github.
3. Go to https://mybinder.org and fill to fields:
  GitHub repository name or URL. For me it looked like "https://github.com/maxfine92/hist", see the repository.
  URL to open (optional). For me it looked like "/voila/render/Hist.ipynb". The last name is your notebook name.
4. Click Launch.
5. Profit! You can now chare your web-page with others.

My example:
https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/maxfine92-hist-zc0uqfp0/voila/render/Hist.ipynb?token=orEydXxsTF6WANpcalRhZg

The histogramm changes when you change the parameters.

UPD. The web page becomes unavailable after some time.
